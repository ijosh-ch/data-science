    "### Question\n",
    "1. What can you conclude about them the measures for X->Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - High conviction is when  ....\n",
    "    - High confidence is when ....\n",
    "    - High lift is ..\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "1. High Conviction:\n",
    "    - **Definition**: Conviction measures the degree of implication of the rule, considering the absence of the consequent (Y).\n",
    "    - **High** **Conviction**: High conviction occurs when the rule X -> Y rarely fails. This means that when X occurs, Y almost always occurs, and the absence of Y when X occurs is rare. High conviction indicates a strong implication of the rule.\n",
    "    - **Example**: If X = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] and Y = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], the conviction is high because the absence of Y when X occurs is rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. High Confidence:\n",
    "    - **Definition**: Confidence measures the proportion of transactions containing X that also contain Y.\n",
    "    - High **Confidence**: High confidence occurs when a high proportion of transactions that contain X also contain Y. This means that X is a strong predictor of Y.\n",
    "    - **Example**: If X = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] and Y = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], the confidence is high because all transactions that contain X also contain Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. High Lift:\n",
    "    - **Definition**: Lift measures how much more likely Y is to occur when X occurs compared to when X does not occur. It is the ratio of the observed support to that expected if X and Y were independent.\n",
    "    - **High** **Lift**: High lift occurs when the presence of X significantly increases the likelihood of Y occurring. This means that X and Y are strongly associated and not independent.\n",
    "    - **Example**: If X = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] and Y = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], the lift is high because the presence of X significantly increases the likelihood of Y occurring.\n"
